# Specification Framework & Process

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for gathering requirements, clarifying specifications, and managing iterative development with safe rollback points.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarifying Questions First
- **ALWAYS** ask clarifying questions before implementation
- **NEVER** assume requirements without confirmation
- **DOCUMENT** all assumptions and decisions
- **VALIDATE** understanding before proceeding

### 2. MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must Have**: Critical features for MVP
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have features
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for current iteration

### 3. Safe Rollback Points
- **Checkpoint commits** after each major feature
- **Feature branches** for experimental work
- **Specification versioning** for requirement changes
- **Documentation snapshots** for decision history

## Specification Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
1. **Initial Requirements**: User provides high-level feature request
2. **Clarifying Questions**: Developer asks specific technical questions
3. **Requirement Confirmation**: User confirms understanding
4. **MoSCoW Classification**: Prioritize requirements

### Phase 2: Specification Creation
1. **Project Specification**: High-level architecture and milestones
2. **Feature Specifications**: Detailed feature requirements
3. **Technical Specifications**: Implementation approach
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done

### Phase 3: Iterative Development
1. **Implementation Planning**: Break down into tasks
2. **Development Cycles**: Short iterations with checkpoints
3. **Review & Feedback**: Regular validation with user
4. **Rollback Safety**: Maintain safe rollback points

## Clarifying Questions Framework

### Technical Architecture Questions
- **Data Structure**: How should data be organized and related?
- **User Experience**: What is the expected user interaction flow?
- **Performance**: What are the performance requirements?
- **Integration**: How should external services be integrated?
- **Scalability**: What are the future scaling considerations?

### Feature Specification Questions
- **Functionality**: What exactly should this feature do?
- **Edge Cases**: How should edge cases be handled?
- **Validation**: What validation rules apply?
- **Error Handling**: How should errors be presented to users?
- **Accessibility**: What accessibility requirements exist?

### Implementation Questions
- **Technology Stack**: Which technologies should be used?
- **Component Architecture**: How should components be structured?
- **State Management**: How should state be managed?
- **Testing Strategy**: What testing approach should be used?
- **Deployment**: How should the feature be deployed?

## Documentation Standards

### Project Specification Document
- **Executive Summary**: High-level project overview
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Architecture**: System architecture and technology stack
- **Milestones**: Development phases and deliverables
- **Constraints**: Technical and business constraints

### Feature Specification Documents
- **Feature Overview**: Purpose and goals
- **User Stories**: Detailed user interaction scenarios
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation specifications
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
- **Dependencies**: Related features and external dependencies

### Decision Log
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Context**: Why the decision was made
- **Alternatives**: What other options were considered
- **Consequences**: Impact of the decision
- **Date**: When the decision was made

## Rollback Strategy

### Checkpoint Management
- **Feature Checkpoints**: After each complete feature
- **Specification Checkpoints**: After requirement changes
- **Architecture Checkpoints**: After major architectural decisions
- **Integration Checkpoints**: After external service integrations

### Rollback Triggers
- **Requirement Changes**: Major scope changes
- **Technical Issues**: Blocking technical problems
- **Performance Issues**: Unacceptable performance degradation
- **User Feedback**: Negative user experience feedback

### Rollback Process
1. **Identify Issue**: Document the problem clearly
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of rollback needed
3. **Execute Rollback**: Return to last safe checkpoint
4. **Update Specifications**: Revise requirements based on learnings
5. **Plan Forward**: Create new implementation approach

## Collaboration Guidelines

## Role-Based Permissions Framework

### Permission Levels

#### Current Phase (Solo/Small Team)
- **Lead Developer/Product Owner**: Full permissions (all actions)
- **CEO/Partner**: Specification review and approval rights
- **Contributors**: Development and PR creation rights

#### Growth Phase (5-15 developers)
- **Tech Lead**: Architecture decisions, spec modifications, release management
- **Senior Developers**: PR approvals, feature spec creation, mentoring
- **Mid-Level Developers**: Feature development, junior developer PR reviews
- **Junior Developers**: Feature development under supervision
- **Product Owner**: Product specification management, feature prioritization

#### Enterprise Phase (15+ developers)
- **Engineering Manager**: Team management, process oversight
- **Principal Engineer**: Architecture governance, technical standards
- **Staff Engineers**: Cross-team coordination, complex feature leadership
- **Domain Experts**: Specialized area ownership (security, performance, etc.)
- **QA Engineers**: Testing standards, quality gate management

### Permission Matrix

| Action | Current Lead | Tech Lead | Senior Dev | Mid Dev | Junior Dev | Product Owner |
|--------|--------------|-----------|------------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **Code & Development** |
| Create PRs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Approve PRs | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ | ❌ |
| Merge to main | ✅ | ✅ | ✅** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

*Mid-level developers can approve junior developer PRs only  
**Senior developers require tech lead approval for production actions  
***Senior developers can propose architecture changes, not unilaterally decide

### Adaptive Permissions

#### Permission Evolution
As the team grows, permissions automatically adjust based on:
- **Experience Level**: Demonstrated competency in codebase
- **Domain Expertise**: Specialized knowledge areas
- **Leadership Responsibilities**: Team mentoring and coordination
- **Business Impact**: Scope of decision-making authority

#### Permission Escalation
- **Technical Escalation**: Complex decisions → Tech Lead → Principal Engineer
- **Product Escalation**: Feature conflicts → Product Owner → CEO
- **Process Escalation**: Team conflicts → Engineering Manager
- **Emergency Escalation**: Production issues → On-call engineer → Tech Lead

### Specification Change Management

#### Change Categories
1. **Minor Changes**: Typos, clarifications, formatting
   - **Who**: Any team member
   - **Approval**: None required (direct commit)
   - **Notification**: Git commit message

2. **Feature Changes**: New features, requirement modifications
   - **Who**: Senior+ developers, Product Owner
   - **Approval**: Tech Lead + Product Owner
   - **Notification**: Team announcement, changelog entry
