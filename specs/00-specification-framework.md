# Specification Framework & Process

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach for gathering requirements, clarifying specifications, and managing iterative development with safe rollback points.

## Core Principles

### 1. Clarifying Questions First
- **ALWAYS** ask clarifying questions before implementation
- **NEVER** assume requirements without confirmation
- **DOCUMENT** all assumptions and decisions
- **VALIDATE** understanding before proceeding

### 2. MoSCoW Prioritization
- **Must Have**: Critical features for MVP
- **Should Have**: Important but not critical
- **Could Have**: Nice to have features
- **Won't Have**: Out of scope for current iteration

### 3. Safe Rollback Points
- **Checkpoint commits** after each major feature
- **Feature branches** for experimental work
- **Specification versioning** for requirement changes
- **Documentation snapshots** for decision history

## Specification Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
1. **Initial Requirements**: User provides high-level feature request
2. **Clarifying Questions**: Developer asks specific technical questions
3. **Requirement Confirmation**: User confirms understanding
4. **MoSCoW Classification**: Prioritize requirements

### Phase 2: Specification Creation
1. **Project Specification**: High-level architecture and milestones
2. **Feature Specifications**: Detailed feature requirements
3. **Technical Specifications**: Implementation approach
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done

### Phase 3: Branch Readiness & Development Initiation
1. **Feature Planning**: Present branch readiness plan following release strategy
2. **User Confirmation**: Ask "Ready to create the branch and start {feature_name} development? 🚀"
3. **Branch Creation**: Only after user confirms, create feature branch
4. **Development Kickoff**: Begin implementation with established patterns

### Phase 4: Iterative Development
1. **Implementation Planning**: Break down into tasks
2. **Development Cycles**: Short iterations with checkpoints
3. **Review & Feedback**: Regular validation with user
4. **Rollback Safety**: Maintain safe rollback points

## Clarifying Questions Framework

### Technical Architecture Questions
- **Data Structure**: How should data be organized and related?
- **User Experience**: What is the expected user interaction flow?
- **Performance**: What are the performance requirements?
- **Integration**: How should external services be integrated?
- **Scalability**: What are the future scaling considerations?

### Feature Specification Questions
- **Functionality**: What exactly should this feature do?
- **Edge Cases**: How should edge cases be handled?
- **Validation**: What validation rules apply?
- **Error Handling**: How should errors be presented to users?
- **Accessibility**: What accessibility requirements exist?

### Implementation Questions
- **Technology Stack**: Which technologies should be used?
- **Component Architecture**: How should components be structured?
- **State Management**: How should state be managed?
- **Testing Strategy**: What testing approach should be used?
- **Deployment**: How should the feature be deployed?

## Documentation Standards

### Project Specification Document
- **Executive Summary**: High-level project overview
- **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
- **Architecture**: System architecture and technology stack
- **Milestones**: Development phases and deliverables
- **Constraints**: Technical and business constraints

### Feature Specification Documents
- **Feature Overview**: Purpose and goals
- **User Stories**: Detailed user interaction scenarios
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation specifications
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Definition of done
- **Dependencies**: Related features and external dependencies

### Decision Log
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Context**: Why the decision was made
- **Alternatives**: What other options were considered
- **Consequences**: Impact of the decision
- **Date**: When the decision was made

## Rollback Strategy

### Checkpoint Management
- **Feature Checkpoints**: After each complete feature
- **Specification Checkpoints**: After requirement changes
- **Architecture Checkpoints**: After major architectural decisions
- **Integration Checkpoints**: After external service integrations

### Rollback Triggers
- **Requirement Changes**: Major scope changes
- **Technical Issues**: Blocking technical problems
- **Performance Issues**: Unacceptable performance degradation
- **User Feedback**: Negative user experience feedback

### Rollback Process
1. **Identify Issue**: Document the problem clearly
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine scope of rollback needed
3. **Execute Rollback**: Return to last safe checkpoint
4. **Update Specifications**: Revise requirements based on learnings
5. **Plan Forward**: Create new implementation approach

### Quality Gates (MANDATORY)

#### Pre-Completion Validation
Before declaring any feature, component, or phase "complete", the following quality gates **MUST** be satisfied:

##### Code Quality Gates
1. **ESLint Validation**: `npm run lint` must pass with **0 errors**
   - All unused variables prefixed with underscore (`_`)
   - No `any` types without justification
   - All imports properly used
   - Consistent code formatting

2. **TypeScript Validation**: `npm run type-check` must pass for **production code**
   - All production components and utilities must compile without errors
   - Test files may have type issues if they don't block core functionality
   - Strict mode compliance required

3. **Build Verification**: `npm run build` must succeed
   - All components must compile for production
   - No build-breaking errors
   - All imports and dependencies resolved

##### Functional Quality Gates
4. **Core Functionality**: Primary use cases must work as specified
   - Manual testing of main user flows
   - Component renders without runtime errors
   - All specified props and callbacks function correctly

5. **Accessibility**: Basic accessibility requirements met
   - Proper ARIA labels and roles
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility

##### Documentation Quality Gates
6. **Code Documentation**: All public APIs documented

- **Rollback**: Features failing quality gates must be rolled back

#### Quality Gate Exceptions
Exceptions to quality gates require:
- **Explicit documentation** of the issue and rationale
- **Approval** from Tech Lead or Lead Developer
- **Timeline** for resolution of the exception
- **Risk assessment** of deploying with known issues

### Process Quality
- **Communication**: Clear, timely communication
- **Documentation**: Thorough documentation of decisions
- **Rollback Safety**: Maintain safe rollback points
- **Continuous Improvement**: Learn from each iteration
- **Quality First**: Never compromise quality gates for speed
