# Release Strategy & Sprint Management

## Overview

This document outlines the release strategy for the 8P3P LMS project, including sprint-based development cycles, release types, and clear contributing guidelines for development teams.

## Sprint-Based Release Cycle

### Configurable Sprint Length

**Default**: 2-week sprints (configurable per project/team needs)

**Supported Sprint Lengths**:
- **1 Week**: Fast-moving features, small team
- **2 Weeks**: Balanced development and review time (recommended)
- **3 Weeks**: Complex features requiring extended development
- **4 Weeks**: Major releases or complex integrations

### Sprint Planning Process

#### Sprint Structure
```
Sprint Planning → Development → Code Review → Testing → Release → Retrospective
     ↓              ↓             ↓          ↓        ↓           ↓
   Day 1         Days 2-8      Days 9-10   Day 11   Day 12   Days 13-14
```

#### Sprint Goals
- **Feature Completion**: All planned features fully implemented and tested
- **Quality Assurance**: All code reviewed and meets quality standards
- **Documentation**: Updated specs and documentation
- **Deployment Ready**: Code ready for production deployment

## Release Types & Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production)
├── release/v1.2.0 (major releases)
├── dev (development integration)
│   ├── feature/timer-01-core
│   ├── feature/timer-02-variants
│   └── feature/auth-improvements
└── hotfix/critical-bug-fix (emergency fixes)
```

### Release Types

#### 1. Feature Releases (Sprint-based)
**Branch Flow**: `feature → dev → release/vX.Y.0 → main`
**Timeline**: End of each sprint
**Process**:
1. Feature branches merge to `dev` throughout sprint
2. Create `release/vX.Y.0` branch from `dev` at sprint end
3. Final testing and bug fixes in release branch
4. Merge release branch to `main` and tag version
5. Deploy to production

#### 2. Hotfixes (Emergency)
**Branch Flow**: `hotfix → main` (direct)
**Timeline**: As needed for critical issues
**Process**:
1. Create `hotfix/issue-description` from `main`
2. Implement fix with minimal changes
3. Test thoroughly (automated + manual)
4. Direct merge to `main` with immediate deployment
5. Cherry-pick to `dev` to keep branches in sync

#### 3. Major Releases (Quarterly)
**Branch Flow**: `dev → release/vX.0.0 → main`
**Timeline**: Every 3-4 sprints or major milestone
**Process**:
1. Feature freeze in `dev` branch
2. Create `release/vX.0.0` for stabilization
3. Extended testing period (1-2 weeks)
4. Documentation updates and migration guides
5. Staged deployment with rollback plan

## Semantic Versioning

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

#### Version Increment Rules
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major architecture updates
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward-compatible changes
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, security patches, hotfixes

#### Examples
```
1.0.0 → 1.0.1  (hotfix: quiz timer bug)
1.0.1 → 1.1.0  (feature: AI integration)
1.1.0 → 2.0.0  (breaking: new authentication system)
```

#### Pre-release Versions
- **Alpha**: `1.2.0-alpha.1` (internal testing)
- **Beta**: `1.2.0-beta.1` (limited user testing)
- **Release Candidate**: `1.2.0-rc.1` (final testing before release)

## Contributing Guidelines

### Development Workflow

#### 1. Sprint Planning
- Review project specifications and feature requirements
- Break down features into PR-sized tasks (200-400 LOC)
- Assign tasks and set sprint goals
- Create feature branches from `dev`

#### 2. Feature Development
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/timer-01-core

# Development cycle
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement core timer component"
git push origin feature/timer-01-core

# Create PR to dev branch
```

#### 3. Code Review Process
- **PR Size**: 200-400 lines of code maximum
- **Single Purpose**: One feature/fix per PR
- **Review Requirements**: 1-2 reviewers minimum
- **Automated Checks**: Lint + tests must pass
- **Documentation**: Update relevant specs and README

#### 4. Stacked PRs (for dependent features)
```bash
# PR #1: Core timer component
feature/timer-01-core → dev

# PR #2: Timer variants (depends on #1)
feature/timer-02-variants → feature/timer-01-core

# When PR #1 merges, PR #2 automatically updates to target dev
```

**Stacked PR Guidelines**:
- **Clear Dependencies**: Document which PRs depend on others
- **Dependency Notes**: Include dependency information in PR description
- **Sequential Merging**: Merge dependencies first, then dependent PRs
- **Conflict Resolution**: Rebase dependent PRs when base PR merges

### Quality Standards

#### Pre-commit Requirements
```bash
# Required checks before PR submission
npm run lint          # ESLint validation
npm run type-check     # TypeScript validation
npm run test           # Unit test execution
npm run pre-commit     # Combined validation script
```

#### PR Review Checklist
- [ ] **Code Quality**: Follows established coding standards
- [ ] **Testing**: Includes appropriate unit/integration tests
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updates specs, README, or comments as needed
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant performance regressions
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Maintains WCAG compliance
- [ ] **Security**: No security vulnerabilities introduced
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Documented and versioned appropriately

### Clean Code & Comments Standards

#### Comment Guidelines
```typescript
/**
 * Timer component for tracking user interactions with time limits
 * 
 * @param duration - Timer duration in seconds
 * @param onComplete - Callback fired when timer reaches zero
 * @param variant - Visual style: 'countdown' | 'stopwatch' | 'progress'
 * 
 * @example
 * <Timer 
 *   duration={240} 
 *   onComplete={handleQuizSubmit}
 *   variant="countdown" 
 * />
 */
export function Timer({ duration, onComplete, variant = 'countdown' }: TimerProps) {
  // Track remaining time with 1-second precision
  const [timeRemaining, setTimeRemaining] = useState(duration);
  
  // Auto-submit when timer expires to prevent data loss
  useEffect(() => {
    if (timeRemaining === 0) {
      onComplete?.();
    }
  }, [timeRemaining, onComplete]);
  
  return (
    <div className="timer-container">
      {/* Visual time display with color coding for urgency */}
      <TimeDisplay 
        time={timeRemaining} 
        variant={variant}
        isUrgent={timeRemaining < 30} // Last 30 seconds = urgent
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

#### Comment Standards
- **Function Headers**: Purpose, parameters, examples
- **Complex Logic**: Explain the "why", not just the "what"
- **Business Rules**: Document business logic and constraints
- **Edge Cases**: Explain handling of edge cases and error states
- **Performance Notes**: Document performance considerations
- **TODO Comments**: Include ticket numbers and timeline
